Quection 1.
Using the short declaration oeprator, ASSIGN these VALUES to VARIABLES with the IDENTIFIERS "x" and "y" and "z"
   a. 42
   b. "James Bond"
   c. true

Now print values stored in those variables using
   a. single print statement
   b. multiple print statements



Question 2.
Use var to DECLARE three variables. The variables should have package level scope.
Do not assign VALUES to the variables. Use the following IDENTIFIERS for the variables and make sure the variables store values of the following TYPES.
   a. identifier "x" type int
   b. identifier "y" type string
   c. identifier "z" type bool

Now in func main
   a. print out the values for each identifier
   b. The compiler assigned values to the variables. What are these values called?



Question 3.
Using code from previous exercise,
A. At the package level scope, assign the following values to the three variables
   a. for x, assign 42
   b. for y, assign "James Bond"
   c. for z, assing true

B. in func main
   Use fmt.sprintf to print all the values to one single string.
   Assign the returned value ot TYPE string using the short declaration oeprator to a VARIABLE eith the IDENTIFIER "s"



Question 4.
A. Create your own TYPE. Have the underlying TYPE be an int.
B. Create a VARIABLE of your new TYPE with the IDENTIFIER "x" using the "var" keyword.
C. in func main
   a. print out the value of the variable "x"
   b. print out the type of the variable "x"
   c. assign 42 to the VARIABLE "x" using the "=" OPERATOR
   d. print out the value of the variable "x"



Question 5.
Building on the code from the previous question

A. At the package level scope, using the "var" keyword, create VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIER "y".
   The variable should be of the UNDERLYING TYPE of your custom TYPE "x"

B. in func main
   a. this should already be done
      i. print out the variable of "x"
     ii.  print out the type of the variable "x"
    iii. assign your own VALUE to the VARIABLE "x" using the "=" OPERATOR
     iv. print out the value of the variable "x"
 
   b. now do this
     i. now use the CONVERSION to convert the TYPE of the VALUE store in "x" to the UNDERLYING TYPE
    ii. then use the short declaration operator to ASSIGN that value to "y"
   iii. print out the value of "y"
    iv. print out the type of "y"
