Quection 1.
Starting with this code (https://go.dev/play/p/U0jea43X55), marshal the []user to JSON. There is a little bit of a curve ball in this hands-on exercise. Remember to ask yourself what you need to EXPORT a value fromm a package.



Question 2.
Starting with this json output, `[{"First":"James","Last":"Bond","Age":32,"Sayings":["Shaken, not stirred","Youth is no guarantee of innovation","In his majesty's royal service"]},{"First":"Miss","Last":"Moneypenny","Age":27,"Sayings":["James, it is soo good to see you","Would you like me to take care of that for you, James?","I would really prefer to be a secret agent myself."]},{"First":"M","Last":"Hmmmm","Age":54,"Sayings":["Oh, James. You didn't.","Dear God, what has James done now?","Can someone please tell me where James Bond is?"]}]` unmarshal the JSON into a GO data structure.
